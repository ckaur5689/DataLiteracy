This repository contains tools and frameworks designed to enhance an organisation's data culture while empowering analysts to effectively share their expertise, work
in partnership with business users and together drive data-informed decision-making.

# Motivation
A data-driven culture is crucial for organisations to make informed decisions, gain a competitive edge, and improve outcomes by leveraging evidence and data rather than assumptions.

This approach fosters agility, enhances collaboration, enables greater customer understanding, and ultimately leads to increased efficiency and profitability by identifying trends, personalising services, and testing hypotheses quickly.

Leveraging the organisation's analytical resource effectively is the flip of this coin. The resources below are geared towards equipping analysts to support their respective organisations to do that.

# Getting the starting blocks into place

# Defining the Problem Statement
A problem statement is a high-level summary of a problem/challenge
It also helps an analyst maintain control when conducting analysis
What a good problem statement consists of:
  # i) Problem/challenge
  # ii) Consequences of not solving it
  # iii) Benefits of solving it
  # iv) Objectives and the end state after it's all solved

# Example: Developing Problem Statements for Health Inequalities in Stroke

# Other Frameworks:

# The Top-Down Thinking Approach
i) Set out the Problem Statement or the Opportunity succintly
ii) The Options (which could be different working hypotheses/options you will be analysing/exploring)
iii) Conclude with your recommended course of action following the results of ii)

# Theory of Change and Logic Models
#TheoryofChange and hashtag#LogicModel are both planning and evaluation tools used in healthcare, public services, and non-profits (including ICBs), but they serve slightly different purposes and offer different levels of detail and abstraction.

Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown:

# üß† Theory of Change (ToC)

‚û°Ô∏èWhat it is:
A high-level, strategic narrative (often with a visual) that explains how and why change is expected to happen in a particular context. It focuses on causal pathways, assumptions, and contextual factors.

Key features:
 ‚Ä¢ Emphasises the why behind the change.
 ‚Ä¢ Begins with the long-term impact and works backward to identify necessary preconditions.
 ‚Ä¢ Includes external influences and assumptions (e.g. political, social, behavioural).
 ‚Ä¢ Often used in complex or system-level interventions.
 ‚Ä¢ More flexible and conceptual than a logic model.

‚û°Ô∏èWhen to use it:
 ‚Ä¢ For strategic planning or programme design.
 ‚Ä¢ To map out how multiple interventions connect to broad systemic change.
 ‚Ä¢ To align stakeholders on shared outcomes.

# üìä Logic Model

‚û°Ô∏èWhat it is:
A practical, structured tool that outlines the inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impact of a programme or project. It shows the what and how in a linear or step-by-step way.

Key features:
 ‚Ä¢ Focuses on program mechanics.
 ‚Ä¢ Begins with inputs/resources and moves forward logically.
 ‚Ä¢ Less emphasis on assumptions and external factors.
 ‚Ä¢ Best used for programme implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.
 ‚Ä¢ Easy to map in Excel or tables.

‚û°Ô∏èWhen to use it:
 ‚Ä¢ For operational planning.
 ‚Ä¢ When designing, tracking, or reporting a project.
 ‚Ä¢ To define KPIs and success metrics for a single initiative.

üéØ Theory of Change vs Logic Model ‚Äî Core Differences
 ‚Ä¢ Level of abstraction: ToC is higher-level and strategic; logic models are more detailed and operational.
 ‚Ä¢ Focus: ToC explains why change will happen; logic models describe how it will happen.
 ‚Ä¢ Assumptions and context: Explicit in ToC, often implicit or excluded in logic models.
 ‚Ä¢ Sequence: ToC is often built from outcomes backward; logic models are built from inputs forward.

üè• Example in ICB Context

Imagine an ICB wants to improve mental health outcomes for young people.
 ‚Ä¢ Theory of Change: Describes how improving digital access, reducing stigma, training teachers, and increasing early intervention will together contribute to a long-term reduction in adolescent mental illness. It maps causal pathways, risk factors, and assumptions about system readiness.
 ‚Ä¢ Logic Model: Details the specific resources (staff, funding, tools), activities (screenings, school workshops), and measurable outputs (students reached, referrals made) along with short-term and long-term outcomes.

# üí° Final Thought

You can think of the Theory of Change as the strategic blueprint; the why and what needs to happen and the Logic Model as the construction plan; the how you‚Äôre going to do it. In practice, they complement each other.
