** Project Scope: Guided Analytics Playbook (Draft)

What We're Doing
Project: Creating a Guided Analytics Playbook
Timeline: 6 months
Project Leads:  
Team: Healthcare Experience Analysts

🧠 Why We're Doing This
	• We want to create a practical playbook that shows how analysts and business users work together effectively in healthcare settings. 
	  It will be full of real examples and useful tips that everyone can actually use day-to-day.

🎯What We Want to Achieve
	•	Pull together 8-12 real examples of analysts working well with business users
	•	Write down the ways of working that actually get results
	•	Help everyone speak the same language when it comes to analytics projects
	•	Make it easier to get new people up to speed
	•	Make sure we're all doing things consistently across the organisation

✅ What's Included (and What Isn't)

📍What goes in the playbook:
	•	8-12 detailed examples from different healthcare areas (patient experience, clinical ops, finance, quality metrics, etc.)
	•	Step-by-step guides for the most common types of analytics work
	•	Templates and tips for communicating well with business users
	•	A simple guide to help decide when analysts should get involved
	•	Reference section on useful tools and techniques
	•	Glossary so everyone knows what we're talking about

📍Types of situations we'll include:
	•	Quick reporting requests
	•	Building and improving dashboards
	•	Digging into problems to find root causes
	•	Predictive modelling projects (applied statistics and machine learning)
	•	Checking data quality
	•	Helping people use analytics tools themselves

📍Format:
	•	Digital playbook (PDF and/or online version)
	•	Diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots to make it  easy to follow
	•	Easy to search and navigate

❌ We're Not Covering
	•	How to use specific analytics software (that's for technical training)
	•	In-depth statistics lessons
	•	Data governance policies
	•	IT infrastructure stuff
	•	Big organisational change programmes

2.	Executive Summary covering the key points (2-3 pages)
3.	Quick Reference Guide with checklists and decision tools
4.	Presentation Slides for launching the playbook and training sessions
5.	Feedback Form so we can keep improving it

⏰ How We'll Do It:

Phase 1: Discovery and Planning (Month 1)
	•	Gather existing examples and documents
	•	Chat with business users and analysts about what works well
	•	Sort out the playbook structure
	•	Agree on style and format

Phase 2: Writing the Content (Months 2 to 4)
	•	Write up the case examples and frameworks
	•	Create diagrams and templates
	•	Develop supporting materials

Phase 3: Review and Improvements (Month 5)
	•	Team review and edits
	•	Get feedback from stakeholders
	•	Make changes based on feedback

Phase 4: Finalising and Launch (Month 6)
	•	Final design and formatting
	•	Create presentation materials
	•	Plan how we'll roll it out
	•	Launch with training sessions

✅ How We'll Know It's Working

	•	At least 60% of analysts are referring to it within 3 months
	•	Good feedback from both analysts and business users (aiming for 4+ out of 5)
	•	Projects get started more smoothly (fewer back-and-forth emails)
	•	Examples are used in at least half of new projects
	•	It becomes part of standard training for new starters

🤔 What We're Assuming
	•	Team members can spend 10-20% of their time on this
	•	Business users will be available for chats and feedback
	•	We can use and adapt existing project examples (made anonymous)
	•	The organisation supports this way of working

# What We'll Need
People:

	•	Business users (for interviews and feedback)
	•	Design support (if possible, for making it look good)
	•	Project coordinator
Tools:

Budget:
	• Time and committment from project analysts

Keeping Everyone Updated
	•	Fortnightly catch ups
	•	Review sessions at the end of each phase
	•	Launch communications through team meetings, emails, and training sessions

What Happens Next
1.	Review and approve this scope
2.	Confirm who's available and what they'll do
3.	Schedule kickoff meeting
4.	Start Phase 1 discovery work
